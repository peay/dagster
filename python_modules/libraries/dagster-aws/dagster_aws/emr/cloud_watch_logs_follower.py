class CloudWatchLogsFollower:
    """
    Tail CloudWatch Logs from log streams.

    CloudWatch Logs has no API to directly stream new log
    events from log streams. Instead, we have to regularly
    fetch new logs using an appropriate ``startTime`` argument.

    When `log_stream_name_prefix` matches multiple log streams,
    it is possible that some log events will be missed.

    Assuming two log streams `A` and `B`, `filter_log_events`
    might returns log events for `B` if those are available. In
    our next call to `filter_log_events`, only events with a
    larger timestamp will be queried. However, if events for `A`
    with an earlier timestamp are pushed to CloudWatch afterwards,
    these will never be queried.

    We could improve this class to handle such cases by querying
    each log stream in isolation, although that can be much less
    efficient if there are many log streams matching the prefix.
    If you need this to be reliable and have only a few log streams,
    consider instantiating one follower per log stream instead of
    relying on a single follower and the prefix.
